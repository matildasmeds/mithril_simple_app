# mithril_simple_app

Tiny project to learn [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org).
Using [Mithril Simple Application Tutorial](https://mithril.js.org/simple-application.html
) as the starting point. The aim is to build something minimal and to focus on very basic things.

## Additions so far
* Create new user
* Delete existing user
* Show success message Create, Update, Delete
* Some CSS tweaks 

## Further ideas
* Clear messages when saving UserForm
* Deploy link
* Implement Error messages
* Paging for list-view
* Tests
* Transition effects (with velocity.js?)
* Translations (just to see how it's done)
