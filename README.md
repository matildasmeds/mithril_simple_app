# mithril_simple_app

Tiny project to learn [mithril.js](https://mithril.js.org).
Using [Mithril Simple Application Tutorial](https://mithril.js.org/simple-application.html
) as the starting point. The aim is to build something minimal and to focus on very basic things.

## Additions so far
* Create & delete user
* Basic success messages
* Clear messages on navigate
* Test src/views/Messages
* Basic pagination
* Simple deploy-script

## Further ideas
* Implement Error messages
* More tests (experiment with jest snapshots)
* Transition effects (with velocity.js?)
* Translations (just to see how it's done)
* Check if mithril-jest really adds value here, or would html5-tidy bring same jest snapshot functionality
* Mark which tab is active visually
* Switch to yarn and see how it works out
